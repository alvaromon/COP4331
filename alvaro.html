                  <h4>Appearance<h4>
                  <p>The American Eel is also know as the pencil eel, yellow eel, black eel, silver eel, Boston eel, Atlantic eel or common eel.

The body is extremely elongated (snakelike), with a very long dorsal fin that is confluent with the anal fin.  Pelvic fins are absent and tiny scales are embedded in the skin giving eels a smooth feel.  The adult color is a yellow-brown with pale underbelly.

It is a distinct species with no known subspecies.  Similar species exist around Japan, Australia and Europe.

This is a gourmet fish in the Asian markets and is often used in Sushi.  It tends to be bony by American standards but is good smoked.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>American eels are found in waters with coastal access along the Atlantic seaboard of the US. 

Eels are primarily riverine but access ponds and lakes.  They orient to structure and flow.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Spawning is still not well understood but fascinating.  The adults migrate to the ocean during autumn.  During the long trek the fish metamorphose into a "silver eel" stage lose their vision and stop eating.  Meanwhile, the gonads expand dramatically.  The fish head to a location near the Sargasso Sea where they spawn en masse and apparently die.  The eggs hatch into leaf-shaped floating leptocephalus larvae that drift with the currents.  When they come within range of a freshwater river, the leptocephalus metamorphoses again into a tiny semi-transparent "glass eel" that buries itself in the sand.  The glass eel that changes again into a pigmented pencil eel and continues its migration upstream to find a habitat to mature and await it's time to go spawn.  This process of spawning in the ocean and maturing inland is termed catadromy (the fish are catadromous).

American eels are opportunistic feeders, which means they eat whatever food is available to them. They are considered carnivorous and eat a variety of food, including fish, frogs, insects and dead organisms.

American eels are known to live as long as 43 years, but generally migrate to spawn and die long before then.</p>

                  <p>Green or greenish blue with metallic luster on back and silvery sides. The chest and abdomen have bony scutes. They typically have several spots along their side.</p>

                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>In Florida, it occurs only in the northeast, mostly in the St. Johns River and Nassau River when it returns from the ocean to spawn, typically between late December and early April.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Plankton feeders, but strike small bright spoons and flies. They are anadromous, meaning they mature in salt water, but return to fresh water rivers to spawn.</p>

                  <h4>Fishing Tips and Facts<h4>
                  <p>Historically the sport fishery was mostly a troll boat fishery with some spin casting from the bank. In recent times, fly fishing has become very popular. The sport fishery is primarily located between Sanford and Melbourne. The flesh is good, especially smoked, and the roe is excellent.</p>

                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Habitat<h4>
                  <p>Unlike most other panfish, crappie spend much of their time offshore feeding on small fish in lakes or in large slow-moving clear water rivers.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>They nest in colonies from February to April. Nests are fanned by males over gravel or muddy bottoms in depths of 3-8 feet, with big fish deeper. Primary food items are crustaceans, aquatic insects and small fishes.</p>
                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>State Record<h4>

                  <h4>Fishing Tips and Facts<h4>
                  <p>Specks are a cool-weather favorite and excellent table fare. Crappies are common throughout Florida. Drift Missouri minnows or grass shrimp below a float, with a #4 hook and small split shot. Depth is key, as crappie school at the same level. When crappie move inshore to spawn, a bright 1/16-oz. to 1/8-oz. jig or Hal-flies will produce.</p>

                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Spawning is still not well understood but fascinating.  The adults migrate to the ocean during autumn.  During the long trek the fish metamorphose into a "silver eel" stage lose their vision and stop eating.  Meanwhile, the gonads expand dramatically.  The fish head to a location near the Sargasso Sea where they spawn en masse and apparently die.  The eggs hatch into leaf-shaped floating leptocephalus larvae that drift with the currents.  When they come within range of a freshwater river, the leptocephalus metamorphoses again into a tiny semi-transparent "glass eel" that buries itself in the sand.  The glass eel that changes again into a pigmented pencil eel and continues its migration upstream to find a habitat to mature and await it's time to go spawn.  This process of spawning in the ocean and maturing inland is termed catadromy (the fish are catadromous).

American eels are opportunistic feeders, which means they eat whatever food is available to them. They are considered carnivorous and eat a variety of food, including fish, frogs, insects and dead organisms.

American eels are known to live as long as 43 years, but generally migrate to spawn and die long before then.</p>

                  <hr class="featurette-divider">
                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Sailfish are a rapidly growing species; they reach 4-5 feet in one year.  They feed aggressively on small fish and squid. Off southeast Florida, sailfish move inshore to shallow water and spawn near the surface in summer. Females swim slowly with their dorsal fins above water, accompanied by one or more males when spawning.</p>

Sailfish are known for their fast runs, acrobatic jumps and head-shaking attempts to throw a hook. Sailfish tire easily and should be revived after a long fight to ensure their survival. Most anglers release these fish.</p>

                  <h4>Behavior<h4>
                  <p>Spawning is still not well understood but fascinating.  The adults migrate to the ocean during autumn.  During the long trek the fish metamorphose into a "silver eel" stage lose their vision and stop eating.  Meanwhile, the gonads expand dramatically.  The fish head to a location near the Sargasso Sea where they spawn en masse and apparently die.  The eggs hatch into leaf-shaped floating leptocephalus larvae that drift with the currents.  When they come within range of a freshwater river, the leptocephalus metamorphoses again into a tiny semi-transparent "glass eel" that buries itself in the sand.  The glass eel that changes again into a pigmented pencil eel and continues its migration upstream to find a habitat to mature and await it's time to go spawn.  This process of spawning in the ocean and maturing inland is termed catadromy (the fish are catadromous).

American eels are opportunistic feeders, which means they eat whatever food is available to them. They are considered carnivorous and eat a variety of food, including fish, frogs, insects and dead organisms.

American eels are known to live as long as 43 years, but generally migrate to spawn and die long before then.</p>
